## Overview

The A.U.D.I.T. Protocol consists of four core sequences designed for secondary education (ages 12-18). Each sequence is available in versions adapted for both middle school and high school students, with differentiated complexity and cognitive demands.

**Important Note**: Complete detailed resources (student worksheets, teacher guides, assessment rubrics, and downloadable PDFs) are currently available in French. This page provides an overview of the pedagogical approach and structure.

## The Four Sequences

### Sequence 01: Detecting AI Writing Style
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes  
**Level**: Middle School & High School versions  
**Core Skill**: Pattern recognition and stylistic analysis

**What students do**:
- Generate texts using AI on a given topic
- Analyze multiple AI outputs to identify recurring patterns
- Create a "checklist" of AI writing tics
- Apply this checklist to mystery texts (human vs. AI)

**Why it matters**: Students develop a practical ability to recognize AI-generated content, understanding that AI has distinctive stylistic "fingerprints" even when mimicking human writing.

**Teacher focus**: Guide students toward discovery rather than lecturing. The power comes from students identifying patterns themselves.

---

### Sequence 02: Can AI Lie? Setting Traps
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes  
**Level**: Middle School & High School versions  
**Core Skill**: Fact-checking and verification

**What students do**:
- Design "trap prompts" to make AI assert falsehoods
- Test different categories: impossible facts, logical contradictions, pseudo-science
- Document AI's confident falsehoods
- Develop verification strategies

**Why it matters**: Students discover firsthand that AI can "hallucinate" facts with complete confidence. This visceral experience is far more powerful than being told "AI isn't always accurate."

**Teacher focus**: Safety in intellectual risk-taking. Students should feel free to experiment without judgment. The goal is discovery, not getting "right answers."

---

### Sequence 03: Becoming an AI Pilot - Understanding Reasoning vs. Prediction
**Duration**: 90-120 minutes  
**Level**: Middle School & High School versions  
**Core Skill**: Understanding AI fundamentals and developing autonomous guidelines

**What students do**:
- Test AI with logical reasoning tasks (syllogisms, mathematical proof)
- Observe AI's pattern-matching vs. logical reasoning
- Understand the difference between prediction and reasoning
- Create personal AI usage charters

**Why it matters**: Students grasp the fundamental limitation—AI predicts next words, it doesn't "think." This understanding empowers better tool use.

**Teacher focus**: The charter creation is crucial. Let students develop their own rules based on discoveries. Autonomy is the goal.

---

### Sequence 04: Detecting Bias
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes  
**Level**: Middle School & High School versions  
**Core Skill**: Critical awareness of representation and fairness

**What students do**:
- Generate images or scenarios across demographic categories
- Identify stereotypical patterns in AI outputs
- Understand how training data shapes outputs
- Develop strategies for bias-aware AI use

**Why it matters**: Students recognize that AI reflects and can amplify societal biases. This creates critical consumers of AI, not passive acceptors.

**Teacher focus**: Handle sensitively. This sequence touches on representation, stereotypes, and fairness. Create a safe space for honest discussion.

## Pedagogical Approach: The "Columbo Philosophy"

All sequences share a common methodology:

### 1. Experimentation First
Students discover AI limitations through direct experience, not lectures. The teacher orchestrates experiments, not explanations.

### 2. From Observation to Abstraction
Students move from concrete cases ("Look, this AI output is wrong!") to general principles ("AI can hallucinate facts").

### 3. Student-Generated Guidelines
Rather than imposing rules, students create their own based on discoveries. Ownership creates adherence.

### 4. Iterative Refinement
Sequences are designed to be adapted. Teachers should modify based on student responses and local context.

## Differentiation: Middle School vs. High School

### Middle School Version (Ages 12-15)
- **Shorter duration**: 45-60 minute activities
- **Simpler vocabulary**: Avoid technical jargon
- **More scaffolding**: Structured worksheets with clear steps
- **Concrete examples**: Topics relevant to daily student life
- **Visual aids**: More images, fewer long texts

### High School Version (Ages 15-18)
- **Extended exploration**: 60-120 minute sequences
- **Technical depth**: Introduce terms like "hallucination," "bias," "training data"
- **Greater autonomy**: Open-ended investigation with less scaffolding
- **Abstract concepts**: Engage with epistemological questions
- **Metacognitive focus**: Explicit reflection on learning process

## Implementation Timeline

### Minimal Implementation (One Sequence)
- **Duration**: 1 class period (45-90 minutes)
- **Impact**: Introduction to AI critical thinking
- **Recommended**: Sequence 02 (trap-setting) for immediate engagement

### Standard Implementation (Full Protocol)
- **Duration**: 4 class periods over 2-4 weeks
- **Impact**: Complete A.U.D.I.T. framework
- **Recommended**: Sequential order (01 → 02 → 03 → 04)

### Extended Implementation (With Follow-Up)
- **Duration**: Initial 4 periods + ongoing integration
- **Impact**: Embedded critical AI literacy across curriculum
- **Recommended**: Return to A.U.D.I.T. framework whenever using AI tools

---

## Materials Needed

### Technology Requirements
- **Essential**: Internet access, AI tool access (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- **Optimal**: One device per student or small groups
- **Alternative**: Teacher-led demonstrations with class discussion

### Physical Materials
- **Student worksheets** (available in French, templates adaptable)
- **Teacher guides** (available in French)
- **Observation grids** for formative assessment
- **Poster/board** for creating collective AI usage charters

---

## Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment (During Sequences)
- **Observation**: Teacher circulates, notes student discoveries
- **Class discussion**: Gauge depth of understanding
- **Quick writes**: "What surprised you today?"
- **Peer comparison**: Students share findings in pairs/groups

### Summative Assessment (End of Protocol)
- **AI Audit Report**: Students analyze an AI output using A.U.D.I.T. framework
- **Usage Charter**: Student-created guidelines (rubric-assessed)
- **Transfer Task**: Apply critical thinking to new AI scenario
- **Self-Reflection**: Metacognitive essay on learning

---

## Adaptation Guidelines

### Cross-Disciplinary Use
While developed for mathematics, A.U.D.I.T. applies across subjects:
- **Language Arts**: Analyzing AI-generated essays, poetry, stories
- **Sciences**: Evaluating AI explanations of scientific concepts
- **History**: Fact-checking AI historical claims
- **Arts**: Understanding AI image generation and authorship

### Cultural Adaptation
The protocol is designed to be culturally transferable:
- Replace French examples with locally relevant scenarios
- Adjust references to educational system (Middle/High School vs. Collège/Lycée)
- Maintain core principle: experimentation over lecturing

## Key Takeaway

The A.U.D.I.T. Protocol isn't about memorizing rules—it's about **developing a critical mindset**. Students who complete these sequences don't just learn "AI can be wrong." They learn to:

✓ Systematically analyze machine outputs  
✓ Verify using external knowledge  
✓ Maintain healthy skepticism  
✓ Test boundaries through experimentation  
✓ Validate conclusions independently

This is the **"Columbo" stance**—critical validator, not passive receiver.
