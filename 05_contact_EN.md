# Contact & Collaboration

## Get in Touch

Whether you're a teacher implementing A.U.D.I.T., a researcher interested in collaboration, or simply curious about critical AI literacy—**your perspectives are valuable**.

---

## For Teachers

### Implementing the Protocol?

**I'd love to hear**:
- What worked well in your classroom?
- What needed modification for your context?
- How did students respond?
- What adaptations did you make?

Your observations help refine the protocol and inform future resources.

### Questions About Implementation?

**Typical inquiries**:
- "Which sequence should I start with?"
- "How do I adapt for my grade level?"
- "What if I don't have one-to-one devices?"
- "How do I assess student learning?"

**Guidance available**: Email with specific questions, and I'll provide practical suggestions based on pilot experiences.

## For Researchers

### Interested in Studying A.U.D.I.T.?

**Potential research directions**:
- Classroom implementation studies
- Comparative analysis across educational systems
- Effectiveness measurement
- Long-term impact on student AI use
- Cross-cultural adaptation

**Open to**:
- Research partnerships
- Co-authored publications
- Conference presentations
- Data sharing (within ethical guidelines)

---

## For Educational Leaders

### Considering System-Wide Implementation?

**Available support**:
- Professional development workshops
- Curriculum integration guidance
- Assessment framework alignment
- Teacher training resources

**Scalability**: The protocol is designed for flexible implementation—from individual classroom experiments to district-wide adoption.

## For International Collaborators

### Adapting for Your Context?

**Especially interested in**:
- Non-Francophone implementations
- Diverse educational systems
- Cultural adaptation examples
- Translated materials (if you create them)

**Vision**: A global community of educators developing critical AI literacy across contexts while respecting local cultural and pedagogical differences.

## Contact Information

**Email**: philippe.dupeyrat@icloud.com

**Response time**: I aim to respond within 1-2 weeks. As an active education inspector, I balance multiple responsibilities—thank you for patience.

**Language**: Correspondence welcome in French or English (though French responses may be faster).

## What to Include in Your Message

To help me provide the most useful response:

### If You're a Teacher
- Your grade level / student age
- Subject area
- Which sequence(s) you've tried or plan to try
- Specific questions or challenges
- Your educational context (country, school type)

### If You're a Researcher
- Your research focus
- Institutional affiliation
- Proposed collaboration or study
- Timeline considerations

### If You're an Educational Leader
- Scope of implementation (classroom, school, district)
- Professional development needs
- Assessment integration questions
- Timeline and support requirements

---

## Sharing Your Adaptations

If you've created modified materials:

**I'm interested in**:
- Translated worksheets (any language)
- Culturally adapted scenarios
- Subject-specific variations (beyond mathematics)
- Assessment tools
- Visual aids or presentation materials

**Credit & Attribution**: Any shared materials remain your intellectual property. If incorporated into the main resource, you'll be credited as contributor.

---

## Feedback on These English Materials

This English-language overview is the first step toward international accessibility. **Your feedback matters**:

- What information is missing?
- What needs clearer explanation?
- What would make implementation easier?
- Should certain French resources be prioritized for translation?

User input directly shapes future development priorities.

---

## Join the Conversation

While there's no formal forum (yet), informal exchange is encouraged:

- Share your A.U.D.I.T. experiences on social media with #AUDITProtocol
- Connect with other teachers implementing critical AI literacy
- Tag @[your platform handle if applicable] to share adaptations

**Community-driven improvement**: The best pedagogical insights often come from practitioners, not theorists.

## Transparency & Limitations

### What I Can Provide
- Pedagogical guidance based on pilot implementations
- Theoretical framework explanations
- Practical implementation suggestions
- Connection to other educators/researchers

### What I Cannot Provide
- Immediate responses (allow 1-2 weeks)
- Technical support for AI tools themselves
- Legal advice on AI use policies
- Guaranteed effectiveness in all contexts

**Honest limitations matter**: The protocol is evidence-informed but not exhaustively researched. It's a practical tool evolving through use.

---

## Privacy Note

**Email correspondence**: I treat all educator inquiries as professional communication. I do not:
- Share your contact information without permission
- Publish classroom experiences without explicit consent
- Use student data (don't send student work without anonymization)

**Research collaboration**: Any data collection follows standard academic ethics protocols with institutional review.

---

## Looking Forward

The A.U.D.I.T. Protocol is a starting point, not a finished product. **Your engagement shapes its evolution**:

- **Today**: Individual implementations inform refinements
- **Near-term**: Shared adaptations create diverse resource library
- **Long-term**: Global community of critical AI literacy educators

**Your contribution—whether a single email or ongoing collaboration—moves this vision forward.**

---

## Final Thought

Critical thinking isn't taught through lectures—it's developed through practice. The same applies to educators developing critical AI literacy instruction.

**We're all learning together.** Your classroom experiences, your adaptations, your questions—they're not just valuable to you. They're valuable to the broader community of educators navigating this unprecedented pedagogical challenge.

**Let's figure this out collaboratively.**
