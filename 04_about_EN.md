## Genesis of the Protocol

The A.U.D.I.T. Protocol emerged from a simple observation: students are using AI tools extensively, but **critical thinking instruction isn't keeping pace**. Traditional approaches—moralizing lectures, blanket bans, or passive acceptance—all fail to prepare students for an AI-integrated reality.

### The Catalyst

As a Mathematics Education Inspector in France, I observed a widening gap:
- Teachers uncertain how to address AI in their pedagogy
- Students using AI without understanding its limitations
- Educational discourse focused on "is AI cheating?" rather than "how do we teach critical AI use?"

The question shifted from **"Should students use AI?"** to **"How do we equip them to use it intelligently?"**

## The "Columbo" Insight

The breakthrough came from rethinking the fundamental pedagogical stance:

**Traditional Model ("Sherlock Holmes")**:
- Student = investigator searching for answers
- Teacher = revealer of enigmas
- AI = threat to authentic learning

**New Model ("Columbo")**:
- Student = critical validator analyzing solutions
- Teacher = orchestrator of learning environments
- AI = imperfect tool generating testable outputs

Just as Lieutenant Columbo knows the culprit but must build the proof, students in the AI era often have access to answers—the challenge is **validating them intelligently**.

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Theoretical Foundation (2023)
Integration of 18 frameworks from educational research:
- Brousseau's Theory of Didactical Situations
- Bloom's Taxonomy (revised)
- Rabardel's Instrumental Approach
- Wineburg's Historical Thinking
- Paul & Elder's Critical Thinking Framework
- And 13 others

### Phase 2: Classroom Testing (2023-2024)
- Piloted with middle and high school teachers
- Iterative refinement based on feedback
- Adaptation for different age groups and subjects
- Documentation of student responses and learning outcomes

### Phase 3: Resource Development (2024)
- Creation of complete sequence materials
- Teacher guides and student worksheets
- Assessment tools and observation grids
- Website launch for broad accessibility

### Phase 4: International Outreach (2025-2026)
- English language overview (this site)
- Invitation for international collaboration
- Sharing of adapted materials from diverse contexts

## About the Author

**Philippe Dupeyrat**  
*Inspecteur d'Académie - Inspecteur Pédagogique Régional (IA-IPR)*  
*Mathematics Education Inspector, France*

### Professional Role

In the French education system, an IA-IPR is responsible for:
- **Pedagogical oversight**: Advising teachers on instructional methods
- **Curriculum development**: Contributing to national mathematics frameworks
- **Assessment design**: Creating and evaluating examination protocols
- **Professional development**: Training teachers in pedagogical innovation

This position provides both classroom proximity (through school visits and teacher collaboration) and systemic perspective (through policy contribution).

### Educational Philosophy

My approach to education rests on three pillars:

**1. Student Agency**  
Learning happens when students discover, not when they're told. The A.U.D.I.T. sequences embody this: students set traps, observe failures, draw conclusions.

**2. Intellectual Honesty**  
Don't tell students "AI is dangerous" or "AI is magical." Give them tools to **evaluate for themselves**. Critical thinking beats moralizing.

**3. Adaptability**  
Technology changes; pedagogical principles endure. The "Columbo" stance—critical validation over passive reception—transcends specific tools.

### Research Interests

- **Didactics of mathematics** in technological contexts
- **Critical thinking** education across disciplines
- **AI literacy** as fundamental civic competency
- **Teacher professional development** for technology integration

## Why International Sharing?

This protocol was developed within the French education system, but **critical AI literacy is a global need**. Students worldwide face the same challenge: abundant access to AI-generated content without corresponding critical evaluation skills.

### What's Transferable

- **The "Columbo" mindset**: Applicable across cultures and education systems
- **The A.U.D.I.T. framework**: Analyze, Use knowledge, Doubt, Interrogate, Test
- **The experimentation pedagogy**: Students discover rather than being lectured
- **The sequence structure**: Adaptable to different subjects and age groups

### What Requires Adaptation

- **Examples and scenarios**: Replace French cultural references with local ones
- **Educational terminology**: Middle/High School vs. Collège/Lycée
- **Assessment formats**: Align with local evaluation practices
- **Language**: Full resources currently in French; English overview here

## Collaboration & Adaptation

### International Teachers Welcome

If you're implementing A.U.D.I.T. in your educational context:
- **Share your adaptations**: How did you modify for your students?
- **Report your experiences**: What worked? What needed adjustment?
- **Contribute examples**: Local scenarios that reveal AI limitations?

**Contact**: philippe.dupeyrat@icloud.com

### Academic Collaboration

For researchers interested in:
- **Studying implementation**: Classroom research on A.U.D.I.T. effectiveness
- **Comparative analysis**: How does critical AI literacy develop across contexts?
- **Theoretical extension**: Building on the "Columbo" framework

**Open to**: Co-authored publications, conference presentations, research partnerships

## Transparency Note

### AI in Creating This Resource

In keeping with the protocol's emphasis on **transparency and critical thinking**, I must note:

**This website (including English translations) was created with assistance from AI tools.** Specifically:
- English translation: AI-assisted with human review
- Website development: AI code generation with human oversight
- Content organization: Collaborative human-AI process

**Why mention this?**

Because the A.U.D.I.T. Protocol teaches students to:
1. Be transparent about AI use
2. Validate AI outputs critically
3. Take responsibility for final content

**"Practice what you preach"** is core to credibility. Using AI to create resources about AI literacy—while being explicit about that use—models the very behavior we want students to develop.

The final content reflects human decisions, expertise, and responsibility. AI was a tool, not the author.

## Philosophy in Practice

The A.U.D.I.T. Protocol isn't just a pedagogical tool—it's a **statement about education in the AI era**:

**We don't reject technology** (unrealistic and counterproductive)  
**We don't embrace it uncritically** (dangerous and naive)  
**We equip students to navigate it intelligently** (empowering and essential)

This middle path—**critical engagement**—is harder than extremes. It requires teachers to:
- Understand AI capabilities and limitations
- Model critical thinking themselves
- Trust students to discover rather than dictate answers
- Admit uncertainty while maintaining pedagogical authority

It's ambitious. But our students deserve nothing less.

*"The goal isn't to make students fear AI or worship it, but to make them intelligent partners in its use. The 'Columbo Teacher' doesn't provide answers—they cultivate the critical mindset to validate them."*
