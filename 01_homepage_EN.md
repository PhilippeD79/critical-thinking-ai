# A.U.D.I.T. Protocol
## Critical Thinking and Artificial Intelligence in Education

---

## The Challenge

Students are using AI. Extensively. Often uncritically. Moralizing discourse—"it's cheating," "you're not developing your brain"—doesn't work. It creates guilt without conviction.

---

## 🔬 The Approach

**Experiment rather than warn.** Students set traps for AI, observe its flaws, and draw their own conclusions. Awareness comes from within.

---

## 🎯 The Objective

Train "AI Pilots": users capable of identifying the machine's weaknesses and deciding when to trust it.

---

## 📦 What You'll Find

Classroom-testable scenarios with teacher guides and student worksheets. No grand theories: concrete, testable, adaptable materials.

---

## The Sequences

Three alerts to discover, one mindset to build. Each sequence exists in versions adapted for middle school and high school students (ages 12-18).

### Sequence 01: Detecting AI Writing Style

AI has recognizable writing tics. Students discover them by analyzing texts they've generated themselves.

**Key learning**: Students learn to identify typical patterns in AI-generated text and understand that AI has a distinctive "signature."

---

### Sequence 02: Can AI Lie? Setting Traps

AI can confidently assert false information. Students set traps to prove it.

**Key learning**: Students discover that AI can "hallucinate" facts and that confidence in delivery doesn't equal accuracy.

---

### Sequence 03: Becoming an AI Pilot

AI doesn't reason—it predicts. Students observe this and create their own usage charter.

**Key learning**: Understanding the fundamental difference between statistical prediction and logical reasoning. Students develop their own critical guidelines.

---

### Sequence 04: Detecting Bias

AI can reproduce and amplify stereotypes. Students learn to detect them.

**Key learning**: Awareness that AI models reflect and can magnify existing societal biases. Critical evaluation of AI outputs through a lens of fairness and representation.

---

## 📚 Real-World Case Studies

Concrete situations to understand AI limitations in practice.

### Case Study: When Claude Invents My Name

The inspector teaching critical thinking about AI discovers that Claude successively calls him "Philippe Music" then "Philippe Dagobert"... A perfect case of hallucination analyzed using the A.U.D.I.T. protocol tools.

**What makes this powerful**: This is an authentic example that happened during the development of this very framework. The creator's own experience with AI hallucination becomes a teaching tool.

---

### Alert: AI Companions - An Invisible Phenomenon

Millions of adolescents are developing emotional connections with conversational AI (Replika, Character.AI, MyIA...). A massive but little-known phenomenon that directly concerns our students. This resource helps teachers understand the mechanisms, identify risks, and implement preventive actions.

---

## 📚 Theoretical Foundations

The conceptual frameworks underlying the A.U.D.I.T. protocol.

### The "Columbo Teacher"

Rethinking mathematics education in the age of artificial intelligence. From the "Sherlock Holmes" model (the student-investigator searching for solutions) to the "Columbo" model (the student-validator analyzing answers). A reflection informed by 18 theoretical frameworks from educational research.

**Core insight**: In the AI era, the pedagogical challenge shifts from raw production to critical analysis and validation of machine-generated solutions.

---

## Your Feedback Matters

These sequences are evolving. If you test them in class, your observations—what works, what doesn't, what you've adapted—will be invaluable to me.

## About This Framework

The A.U.D.I.T. Protocol was developed by Philippe Dupeyrat, Mathematics Education Inspector, France.

Originally created for the French education system, this methodology is designed to be adaptable to international contexts.

**Complete pedagogical resources** (detailed worksheets, teacher guides, assessment rubrics) are available in French at: https://philipped79.github.io/audit-ia

## The A.U.D.I.T. Acronym

**A**nalyze - Examine AI outputs critically  
**U**se your knowledge - Apply disciplinary expertise  
**D**oubt - Maintain healthy skepticism  
**I**nterrogate limits - Test AI boundaries  
**T**est - Verify and validate

This five-step framework provides students with a systematic approach to interacting with AI tools across all disciplines.
